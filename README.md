Source code of the sixth problem set in the CS50x course utilizing web developing languages.

This was the first massive shift in the course. We began to rapidly learn web development including DHTML, PHP, and MySQL.

'/includes' holds the contents of the functions we call often in each of the dynamic webpages. 'config.php' acts as a main require call for each of the webpages. 'functions.php' holds all the used functions within the webpages, including a function for MySQL queries.

'pset7.sql' is the contents of the database in which we used to test the website.

'/public' contains all of the PHP source code for the functionality of each of the web pages, and also holds the contents of the css and js (we were using Bootstrap!).

'templates' contains the html that is rendered whenever the call is made by PHP! (This was truly amazing learning and implementing this structure for a website!)
